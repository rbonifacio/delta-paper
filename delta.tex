DOP, Delta Oriented Programming, is a novel programming language approach focused on  modularity, expressiveness and flexibility for the development of software product lines ~\cite{}. DOP uses the concept of delta modules, which are units of modularity that specifies changes to be applied to a core module (minimal implementation of the mandatory features of a product) in a partial order.
A core module is a valid product build using tradicional single application engenieering techiniques. The concept of core module was conceived in a proof-of-concept implementation of DOP, called Core Delta, in a later version, Pure Delta,  the need for a predefined core module was abandoned. ~\cite{}.

\subsection{DeltaJava and Core DOP}
DOP is not restricted to any specific programming language, and was prototyped in Java, in a tool named DeltaJava. Deltas in DeltaJava can augment, modify or remove code from core deltas modules, on the class level or class structure level ~\cite{}. 

Delta modules are similar to features modules in a way it is possible to add or modify the beahvior of a base product, but DOP extends the capabilities of FOP by an operator able to remove code.
